				***Data Dictionary - tidyURIHAR dataset******About the data***The authors carried out experiments with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. From each window a vector of 561 features was obtained. The features were then narrowed down to include on those containing mean or standard deviation values.The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals ***Variable Names***1) Subject - one of a group of 30 volunteers who carried out the experiment  Type: Number ; Values: 1-302) Activity - one of six activities performed as part of the experiment  Type: char: Values: walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing,, laying Variables:General description: Feature names are constructed as follows:   Char 1: Domain of the variable: values: t=time, f=frequency   Motion component: values: Body, Gravity   Sensor: values: acc = accelerator,gyro = gyroscope   Jerk Signals(optional): value: Jerk   Magnitude (Optional): value: Mag   Measure: values: std =standard deviation, mean = mean, meanFreq = mean                   Frequency    Coordinate: Name of axial coordinate; value =X,Y,Z Example deconstructions:t|Body|Acc|mean|X - time|Body|Accelerator}mean|XtBodyAccJerkmeanX - time|Body|Accelerator|Jerk|mean|XtBodyGyroJerkmeanX - time|Body|Gyroscope|Jerk|mean|XfBodyBodyGyroJerkMag|meanFreq - frequency|Body|Gyroscope|Jerk|Magnitude|mean Frequency***List of selected variable names***Variable Name1. tBodyAccmeanX2. tBodyAccmeanY3. tBodyAccmeanZ4. tBodyAccstdX5. tBodyAccstdY6. tBodyAccstdZ7. tGravityAccmeanX8. tGravityAccmeanY9. tGravityAccmeanZ10. tGravityAccstdX11. tGravityAccstdY12. tGravityAccstdZ13. tBodyAccJerkmeanX14. tBodyAccJerkmeanY15. tBodyAccJerkmeanZ16. tBodyAccJerkstdX17. tBodyAccJerkstdY18. tBodyAccJerkstdZ19. tBodyGyromeanX20. tBodyGyromeanY21. tBodyGyromeanZ22. tBodyGyrostdX23.tBodyGyrostdY24.tBodyGyrostdZ25. tBodyGyroJerkmeanX26. tBodyGyroJerkmeanY27. tBodyGyroJerkmeanZ28. tBodyGyroJerkstdX29. tBodyGyroJerkstdY30. tBodyGyroJerkstdZ31. tBodyAccMagmean32. tBodyAccMagstd33. tGravityAccMagmean34. tGravityAccMagstd35. tBodyAccJerkMagmean36. tBodyAccJerkMagstd37. tBodyGyroMagmean38. tBodyGyroMagstd39. tBodyGyroJerkMagmean40. tBodyGyroJerkMagstd41. fBodyAccmeanX42. fBodyAccmeanY43. fBodyAccmeanZ44. fBodyAccstdX45. fBodyAccstdY46. fBodyAccstdZ47. fBodyAccmeanFreqX48. fBodyAccmeanFreqY49. fBodyAccmeanFreqZ50. fBodyAccJerkmeanX51. fBodyAccJerkmeanY52. fBodyAccJerkmeanZ53. fBodyAccJerkstdX54. fBodyAccJerkstdY55. fBodyAccJerkstdZ56. fBodyAccJerkmeanFreqX57.fBodyAccJerkmeanFreqY58. fBodyAccJerkmeanFreqZ59. fBodyGyromeanX60. fBodyGyromeanY61. fBodyGyromeanZ62. fBodyGyrostdX63. fBodyGyrostdY64. fBodyGyrostdZ65. fBodyGyromeanFreqX66. fBodyGyromeanFreqY67. fBodyGyromeanFreqZ68. fBodyAccMagmean69. fBodyAccMagstd70. fBodyAccMagmeanFreq71. fBodyBodyAccJerkMagmean72. fBodyBodyAccJerkMagstd73.fBodyBodyAccJerkMagmeanFreq74. fBodyBodyGyroMagmean75. fBodyBodyGyroMagstd76. fBodyBodyGyroMagmeanFreq77. fBodyBodyGyroJerkMagmean78. fBodyBodyGyroJerkMagstd79. fBodyBodyGyroJerkMagmeanFreq
